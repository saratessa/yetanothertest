    "description": "The correlation matrix provides insights into the relationships between different mathematical skills by measuring how strongly they are associated with each other. These relationships are quantified on a scale from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect positive relationship (as one skill increases, the other increases proportionally), 0 indicates no relationship between skills, and -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship (as one skill increases, the other decreases proportionally).",
